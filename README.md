## How to reset bios

If you are like me and scr€wed the bios into a unbootable state, you will find out there is no bios reset button or power up sequence that erases back to default.

But there is a way to reset it :) !  

* Please remember first boots take a long time (in one case it tooks 3 minutes!), do not power off the device for at least 5 minutes.*

__BIOS RESET PROCEDURE:__

1. Power off device, remove mains plug.
2. Open device top lid
3. Disconnect the built in clock battery using a long screw driver
4. Insert mains plug, power device on, and wait (really wait a few minutes)
5. Bios should be back to default.
6. Power off device again, remove mains plug
7. Reconnect the battery plug into position with the long screw driver
8. Close lid and repeat step 4 (with faster boot now)
   
The bios will reset to default and after that the battery can be reconnected.
